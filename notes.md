## CSR vs SSR thoughts

- When to use client-side rendering vs server-side?
    - If a user needs to log in to view a page, then CSR is a better option, search engines will not be able to view authenticated data so SEO is not important here. 

    - If a user is requesting a page viewable by SEO and scrapers then server-side rendering is a better option.
